//Par array stores final parent of the node after running findpar function
//Optimizations:
//1. Works like assigning main parent to all intermediate nodes while unwinding from recursion
//2. Here merge happens by height that is if one connected component height's is x, another is y and x>y then while merging x and y, y would get attached to x
//These 2 optimzations make DSU way faster making it runable in approximately amorized constant time
